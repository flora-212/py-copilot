# ðŸ¤– Py-Copilot

## Introduction
**Py-Copilot** igit remote add origins a VSCode extension that enables Python programs to interact directly with GitHub Copilot.  
It supports sending messages programmatically, attaching file context, and running structured prompts.  

With these features, Py-Copilot lays the foundation for **automated evaluation of Copilotâ€™s performance across different models** â€”  
especially in scenarios where models are adapting other code completion methods to new datasets and contexts.

---

## âœ¨ Features
- ðŸ“© Send messages to Copilot directly from Python programs  
- ðŸ“Ž Attach file context to enrich prompts  
- ðŸ”„ Run structured prompts to simulate dataset-specific testing scenarios  
- ðŸ“Š Evaluate how Copilot models perform when adapting other code completion methods to new datasets and contexts *(partially implemented, designed for further extension)*    
- ðŸ§ª **Planned**: Automate evaluation of Copilot across multiple models *(not yet implemented, but the framework supports it)*

## ðŸš€ Installation

### Prerequisites
Before installing this project, make sure you have:

**Required:**
- **Visual Studio Code** 1.103.0 or higher
- **Python** 3.6 or higher 
- **Node.js** 16.0 or higher and **npm**
- **GitHub Copilot Chat** extension (installed in VS Code)

**Python Libraries:**
- `tkinter` (usually comes with Python, for GUI interface)
- All other required libraries are part of Python standard library (`urllib`, `json`, `os`, etc.)

**Optional for development:**
- `requests` library (only needed for `test_client.py`)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/py-copilot.git
cd py-copilot
```

2. **Install Node.js dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Build the extension:**
```bash
npm run compile
```

4. **Install in VS Code:**
   - Press `F5` to run the extension in a new Extension Development Host window
   - Or package and install: `npm run package` then install the generated `.vsix` file

5. **Verify Python setup:**
```bash
python --version  # Should be 3.6+
python -c "import tkinter"  # Should not raise an error
```

### Optional: Install Python test dependencies
If you want to run the test client with requests library:
```bash
pip install requests
```

---

## ðŸ“– Usage

### 1. Project Configuration Dialog
For structured adaptation tasks:
```bash
python client/project_client.py
```
This opens a GUI where you can:
- Specify technology and benchmark names
- Set paths to technology and benchmark folders  
- Add context from papers or documentation
- Preview the generated message before sending

### 2. Simple Command-Line Client
For quick queries:
```bash
python client/simple_client.py "your message" [optional_path_for_additional_file]
```

### 3. Test Client (with requests library)
If you have `requests` installed:
```bash
python client/test_client.py
```

**Note:** The VS Code extension must be running for Python clients to communicate with Copilot.
